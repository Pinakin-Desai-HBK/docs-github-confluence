# One or more sync blocks.  Each block defines a GitHub source and the
# Confluence destination.
#
# Tree-sync mode (recommended):
#   Set docs_root to the repository folder you want to mirror.
#   All Markdown files under that folder are synced, preserving directory
#   structure as nested Confluence pages.  confluence_parent_id is required.
#
# Legacy mode (explicit document list):
#   Use the documents: list to map individual files to Confluence titles.
